				<h2>About Me!</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Hello! My name is Radhyyah Hossain and I am a Computer Science student from Hunter College. I mainly work
				on app
				development using Flutter but lately have taken an interest in using AI
				in both app and web development to futher my skills. <br /><br />And today, I am a Co-Founder to a
				volunteer-run
				nonprofit organization named LocalDevs! Our goal is to
				create apps and websites that look to unify health and tech to promote social, economic, and health
				equity in cities like NYC.

					<h3>The Pocket Pantry</h3>
					<p>My biggest project yet which is available in the AppStore! I was the app engineer in my team and
						used Flutter and Hive database to
						create The Pocket Pantry! It was made to help people find food banks and soup kichens
						easier. <br /> <br />Since this type of information is scattared across many government
						websites, we
						decided
						to provife users to this information in one cohesive place and use filters such as boroughs,
						hours, special requirements, and even if it's mobile or kosher and
						more! This is to make sure People can get the relevant information they need without having to
						scower for it! We also added the requirements or special notes for each place to ensure people
						can get the resources they require!

					<h3>HalalApp</h3>
					<p> My other flutter project which I would like to publish as well! I used Flutter to create an app
						that helps users find halal restaurants in
						NYC. <br /><br />It is tailored to the needs of the Muslim community in New York City since
						searching on
						google doesn't always provide with accurate information. A problem I face myself is finding out
						that a resturant I googled is closed by the time I get there so it is helpful to know and even
						plan where to go based on what is open and what I prefer. I used Firebase to
						implement CRUD operations to store and receive data of restaurants in NYC which
						included pictures, hours, boroughs, and more details.

					<h3>HeadStarter Fellow</h3>
					<p> Currently in the Headstarter Fellowship where my team and I are collaborating to weekly projects
						that range from developing personal websites to exploring involvement in AI projects. It is both
						personal and team projects, so as my personal progress work, HeadStarter provides its fellows
						with LeetCode practice sessions facilitated by an AI teacher, provided by Headstarter, to
						enhance problem-solving skills and coding proficiency. AI projects will also be done in later
						weeks of the program!

					<h3>Headstarter Hackathon</h3>
					<p> Also have done a Headstarter Hackathon prior to the fellowship! My teammate and I used a Large
						Language Model(LLM) to create a project. We created an AI-powered chat interface utilizing LLM
						to extract text from PDF documents, so users can ask questions related to an document and is
						answered using artificial intelligence, written with python to make a pdf reader. We even
						managaed to win third place!

					<h3>Bloomberg L.P. Intern</h3>
					<p>I interned at Bloomberg L.P. and created a web application for the Bloomberg Company that aids
						online group presentations by developing a notification system that alerts the
						group without disturbing the flow of the presentation using HTML, CSS, JS, React JS, and the
						Websocket API. This was created so presentations flow better and takes up less time in having
						people prepare for their turn to speak!

					<h3>CodePath</h3>
					<p> I participated in the IOS CodePath program and learned the basics of iOS development and
						design, used Swift to build apps such as a tip
						calculator, Twitter app clone, and Instagram app clone using Twitter API. They're shown in my
						github!</p>
